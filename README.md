# n8n-templates

This repository is a collection of **n8n templates** I’ve created.  
Each template is stored in its own folder, with the following structure:

```
template-name/
├── template.json   # The actual n8n template
└── README.md       # A description and explanation of the template
```

## Usage
1. Browse the folders to find a template you’re interested in.  
2. Open its `README.md` to see details and setup instructions.  
3. Import the `template.json` into your n8n instance.  

## Notes
- Templates may vary in complexity (from minimal authentication examples to full workflows).  
- Feel free to adapt them to your own use cases.

Happy automating with n8n ✨
